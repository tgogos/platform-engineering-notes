*I really think that platform engineering is probably **DevOps**, in that you can't build a platform engineering product because **it's a philosophy, it's a way of operating. It's a social invention, not a technical invention.** I think there are a lot of technical challenges in conventions being hammered out in the ground right now, as we speak.*

*"Platform engineering" is a response from people who heard **"devops is a culture, not a set of tools"** and instead of listening to why that's important **they attempted to take any kind of culture out of it and replace it with tools.** You cannot convince me otherwise*

*Platform Engineering is like we got together the smartest people in the industry and they were like, “Well, crap, I dunno, you figure it out.”*  
*⌞ Duct tape. It’s all held together with duct tape"*  
*⌞ No, no, no. That was DevOps. You now need to engineer a better tape. Work with your app teams, understand how the duct tape was used and build a super tape that is tailored to your duct tape usage.*
