*I really think that platform engineering is probably **DevOps**, in that you can't build a platform engineering product because **it's a philosophy, it's a way of operating. It's a social invention, not a technical invention.** I think there are a lot of technical challenges in conventions being hammered out in the ground right now, as we speak.*

*"Platform engineering" is a response from people who heard **"devops is a culture, not a set of tools"** and instead of listening to why that's important **they attempted to take any kind of culture out of it and replace it with tools.** You cannot convince me otherwise*

## Darren Shepherd

*Platform Engineering is like we got together the smartest people in the industry and they were like, “Well, crap, I dunno, you figure it out.”*  
*⌞ Duct tape. It’s all held together with duct tape"*  
*⌞ No, no, no. That was DevOps. You now need to engineer a better tape. Work with your app teams, understand how the duct tape was used and build a super tape that is tailored to your duct tape usage.*

## Sam Newman

*The reality is, much of the effort around platform engineering is NOT about empowering developers, **it’s about hiding the towering pile of crap we’ve assembled and now have to hide from the people we apparently got it for in the first place**. It’s like buying a bunch of presents for a child, then having to hide them because they’re too dangerous for them to use, and in reality you really got them for yourself. Did your kid really need that compound hunting bow?*
