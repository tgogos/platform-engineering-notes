*I really think that platform engineering is probably **DevOps**, in that you can't build a platform engineering product because **it's a philosophy, it's a way of operating. It's a social invention, not a technical invention.** I think there are a lot of technical challenges in conventions being hammered out in the ground right now, as we speak.*

*"Platform engineering" is a response from people who heard **"devops is a culture, not a set of tools"** and instead of listening to why that's important **they attempted to take any kind of culture out of it and replace it with tools.** You cannot convince me otherwise*
